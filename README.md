# Simulated-Annealing
Hi, I made this project during 2 months of internship at C-DAC. The Instructor during the session was Jitesh Choudhary Sir (Director of Centre of Development for Advanced Computing). I got to learn a lot during these days and it was a great experience learning with C-DAC. Everything was explained from the very basics. I enjoyed these 2 months.
